<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>By day, I speak fluent cybersecurity—whispering sweet nothings to firewalls and decoding acronyms like it’s a competitive sport. 
  By night, I’m a calorie-wrangling kitchen ninja, dodging tree nuts and turning Mediterranean vegan meals into edible masterpieces that somehow still fit my macros. 
  Currently surviving the 75 Hard challenge, which is basically adulting with extra reps. If you spot someone running, cycling,
   and calculating Chick’n sandwich calories at the same time—that’s probably me.</p>

<p>When I'm not outsmarting spreadsheets or decoding the nutritional mystery behind granola clusters, I moonlight as a one-man adventure squad. Scenic trails become my playground, cycling is my meditation, and running is just me trying to outrun yesterday’s version of myself. 
  I approach fitness like I approach cybersecurity—strategically, with a sprinkle of madness and a dash of peanut butter. 
  Life’s too short to eat boring food or skip leg day, so I do neither. </p>

<p>Now I’m adding full stack web development to my ever-evolving toolkit—because why just protect the internet when you can help build it too? 
  I’m diving into code like it’s a new workout, pushing through the logic reps and debugging sprints. Learning to develop front to back means I get to create sleek interfaces and secure backends that play nice with my cybersecurity know-how. Besides, 
  nothing says “level up” like designing a plant-based meal tracker that’s as functional as it is flavor-packed.
